Turai × VibePost Integration Proposal

Overview

This document proposes an API integration between Turai (AI-powered location tours) and VibePost (social media automation platform) to enable automated, trend-responsive content generation.

The Concept: VibePost identifies trending topics and relevant conversations across X, Reddit, and Discord. Turai generates location-based visual postcards that connect those trends to real places, which VibePost can then share across platforms.

Use Cases

1. Trend-Responsive Content

Trend: "Solar eclipse 2024" trending on X
VibePost: Identifies the trend and relevant locations (Carbondale, IL)
Turai: Generates postcard for Carbondale with eclipse-themed narrative
VibePost: Posts to X/Instagram with trending hashtags
2. Event-Based Marketing

Trend: "Taylor Swift Eras Tour Nashville"
Turai: Creates Nashville tour postcard with Swiftie angle
VibePost: Replies to relevant conversations with visual content
3. Seasonal Content

Trend: "Best fall foliage 2024"
Turai: Generates postcards for Vermont, Smoky Mountains, etc.
VibePost: Shares across multiple platforms with platform-optimized aspect ratios
4. Location Discovery

Trend: "Hidden gems in Utah"
Turai: Creates postcards for lesser-known Utah locations
VibePost: Posts as content series across social platforms
Proposed API Design

Endpoint

POST /api/postcards/generate-by-topic

Request Format

{
  "location": {
    "name": "Nashville, TN",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 36.1627,
      "lng": -86.7816
    }
  },
  "topic": "Taylor Swift Eras Tour",
  "aspectRatio": "1:1",
  "stylePreset": "vibrant",
  "contextHint": "Focus on music venues and cultural significance"
}

Request Parameters

Parameter	Type	Required	Description	Example Values
location.name	string	Yes*	Human-readable location	"Nashville, TN", "Route 66"
location.coordinates	object	Yes*	Lat/lng coordinates	{lat: 36.16, lng: -86.78}
topic	string	Yes	Trending topic or theme	"Solar eclipse", "Fall foliage"
aspectRatio	string	No	Social platform format	"1:1", "9:16", "4:5", "16:9", "1.91:1"
stylePreset	string	No	Visual style	"vibrant", "classic", "minimal"
contextHint	string	No	Additional context for AI	"Focus on family activities"
*Either location.name OR location.coordinates required (or both)

Response Format

{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "imageUrl": "https://turai.com/postcards/abc123.png",
    "caption": "Experience Nashville like a true Swiftie! 🎸 Explore the music venues that shaped her career...",
    "location": {
      "name": "Nashville, TN",
      "lat": 36.1627,
      "lng": -86.7816
    },
    "aspectRatio": "1:1",
    "generatedAt": "2024-11-16T10:30:00Z"
  }
}

Error Response

{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "GENERATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Unable to generate postcard for the specified location",
    "details": "No relevant location data found"
  }
}

Authentication Options

Option 1: API Key (Recommended)

VibePost includes API key in request header: X-API-Key: your_key_here
Simple, secure, trackable
Allows rate limiting per integration partner
Option 2: Public Endpoint with Rate Limiting

No authentication required
Global rate limit (e.g., 100 requests/hour per IP)
Simpler integration but less control
Option 3: OAuth (If needed)

Full OAuth flow for more complex integrations
Probably overkill for this use case
Question for VibePost: Which authentication approach works best for your architecture?

Platform-Specific Aspect Ratios

Turai already supports platform-optimized formats:

Platform	Aspect Ratio	Dimensions	Use Case
Instagram Post	1:1	1080×1080	Feed posts
Instagram Story	9:16	1080×1920	Vertical stories
Instagram Portrait	4:5	1080×1350	Portrait posts
Facebook	16:9	1200×630	Link previews
LinkedIn	1.91:1	1200×627	Professional sharing
Question for VibePost: Do you need additional aspect ratios or custom dimensions?

Advanced Features (Optional)

Batch Generation

Generate multiple postcards in one request:

{
  "requests": [
    {
      "location": {"name": "Nashville, TN"},
      "topic": "Taylor Swift",
      "aspectRatio": "1:1"
    },
    {
      "location": {"name": "Nashville, TN"},
      "topic": "Taylor Swift",
      "aspectRatio": "9:16"
    }
  ]
}

Question: Would batch generation be valuable for your workflow?

Webhook Callbacks

For async processing of large batches:

{
  "location": {"name": "Nashville, TN"},
  "topic": "Taylor Swift",
  "aspectRatio": "1:1",
  "webhookUrl": "https://vibepost.com/callbacks/postcard-ready"
}

Question: Do you need async/webhook support, or is synchronous generation sufficient?

Pre-Generated Templates

Turai could maintain a cache of popular location postcards:

GET /api/postcards/trending?topic=solar-eclipse
Returns already-generated postcards for common topics
Question: Would pre-cached postcards be useful, or do you always need fresh content?

Rate Limits & Pricing

Questions for Discussion:

Expected volume: How many postcards would VibePost generate per day/week?
Peak usage: Are there burst periods (trending event happens, need 50 postcards immediately)?
Cost structure: Should this be:
Free tier with limits
Pay-per-generation
Flat monthly fee
Part of existing Live Discovery subscriptions
Technical Implementation Timeline

If we proceed, here's a rough implementation plan:

Week 1: Build API endpoint with basic location + topic → postcard generation
Week 2: Add authentication, rate limiting, error handling
Week 3: Testing with VibePost team, refinement based on feedback
Week 4: Production deployment with monitoring
Open Questions for VibePost

Please provide feedback on the following:

Core Functionality

 Does the proposed request/response format work for your needs?
 Are there additional parameters you'd need (e.g., text overlay customization, branding options)?
 Do you need the ability to specify multiple locations for one topic?
Authentication & Security

 Which authentication method works best for VibePost's architecture?
 Do you need separate API keys for dev/staging/production environments?
Features & Workflow

 Is synchronous generation acceptable, or do you need async/webhooks?
 Would batch generation be valuable (generate 5 postcards in one request)?
 Do you need the ability to regenerate with the same parameters if the first result isn't ideal?
Integration Details

 What's your preferred error handling approach?
 Do you need health check/status endpoints to monitor Turai availability?
 Should Turai provide usage analytics (how many postcards generated per topic/location)?
Content & Customization

 Do you want to provide custom caption templates, or trust Turai's AI?
 Should postcards include VibePost branding or stay neutral?
 Any content restrictions or compliance requirements?
Volume & Pricing

 Estimated volume: ___ postcards per day/week/month
 Peak burst needs: ___ postcards simultaneously
 Budget expectations: Free tier / pay-per-use / subscription
