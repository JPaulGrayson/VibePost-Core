Here are the three distinct implementation prompts for your VibePost Replit Agent.

Since VibePost is already set up to "Listen -> Analyze -> Reply," these prompts focus on **tuning the "Brain"** (the LLM system prompt and keyword watchers) to look for Developer Pain instead of Travel Plans.

You can paste these into VibePost’s `instructions.md` or directly into the chat.

### 1. Strategy: "The Spaghetti Detective"

**Goal:** Find developers complaining about complex code and offer a visual solution.

> **Prompt for VibePost Agent:**
> "I need to create a new 'Listening Campaign' for my other app, **LogiGo** (a code-to-flowchart visualizer).
> **1. Add New Keywords:**
> Please update the Twitter/X monitoring logic to track these specific phrases and hashtags:
> * `"spaghetti code"`
> * `"refactoring hell"`
> * `"codebase is a mess"`
> * `"lost in the code"`
> * `"debugging nightmare"`
> * `"can't understand this legacy code"`
> 
> 
> **2. Update the Intent Classifier:**
> When a post matches these keywords, analyze it for **'Complexity Pain.'**
> * **Ignore:** Generic tech news or tutorials.
> * **Target:** Personal complaints where a developer is expressing frustration about understanding logic.
> 
> 
> **3. Reply Generation Strategy:**
> If the intent matches, generate a draft reply using this persona:
> * **Tone:** Empathetic developer (not a sales bot).
> * **Content:** 'I feel that pain. I usually have to map it out visually to make sense of it. I built a tool called LogiGo to do that automatically if you want to try it.'
> * **Call to Action:** Link to `https://logigo.studio`."
>

### 2. Strategy: "The Vibe Coding Scout"

**Goal:** Find early adopters of Replit/Antigravity and offer them a "Founder" account.

> **Prompt for VibePost Agent:**
> "I want to target the 'Vibe Coding' community to find beta testers.
> **1. Add New Keywords:**
> Track these high-signal tags:
> * `#vibecoding`
> * `#replitagent`
> * `"cursor ai"`
> * `"google antigravity"`
> * `"built this with AI"`
> 
> 
> **2. Update the Intent Classifier:**
> Analyze posts for **'Show and Tell'** or **'Workflow Sharing.'**
> * **Target:** Users showing off an app they built or discussing their AI coding workflow.
> 
> 
> **3. Reply Generation Strategy:**
> * **Tone:** Impressed and collaborative. 'Builder to Builder.'
> * **The Hook:** Offer them a 'Founder Account' (Free Lifetime Access) because they are an early adopter.
> * **Template Idea:** 'This looks great. Since you're building with agents, I’d love to give you a Founder account on LogiGo (my AI flowchart tool). It helps visualize the agent's logic when it gets stuck. let me know if you want an invite.'"
>

### 3. Strategy: "The Stack Overflow Visualizer" (Advanced)

**Goal:** Find technical questions that are best answered with a diagram.

> **Prompt for VibePost Agent:**
> "I want to experiment with 'Service Marketing' by finding questions that need visual answers.
> **1. Add New Keywords:**
> Track keywords that imply a need for structure or comparison:
> * `"architecture diagram"`
> * `"how does oauth work"`
> * `"react state flow"`
> * `"mvc vs mvvm"`
> * `"visualize the request"`
> 
> 
> **2. Update the Intent Classifier:**
> Analyze for **'Visual Curiosity.'**
> * **Target:** Questions asking about data flow, system architecture, or state management.
> 
> 
> **3. Reply Generation Strategy:**
> * **Tone:** Helpful expert.
> * **Content:** Instead of just explaining it in text, offer a visualization.
> * **Draft:** 'That's a tricky flow. It helps to see it mapped out. I can generate a flowchart for that specific architecture using LogiGo if you're interested?'
> 
> 
> *(Note to Agent: In the future, we will connect this to the LogiGo API to auto-generate the image, but for now, just draft the offer).* "

### Immediate Next Step

I recommend starting with **Prompt #2 (The Vibe Coding Scout)**.

1. It targets your exact peer group.
2. It is high-value (offering a "Founder" status gift).
3. It has the lowest risk of looking like spam because you are replying to people who *want* to talk about their AI projects.

**Shall we fire up the "Scout" prompt first?**
