# LogicArt Discord Campaign - Raw Material for Vibepost

## Core Value Proposition

- Turns TypeScript/JavaScript into interactive flowcharts
- GitHub deeplink feature: paste any GitHub URL, instant visualization
- Not just visualization: complexity analysis, bug detection, execution path counting
- Open source: github.com/JPaulGrayson/Logicart
- Website: logic.art

## Target Discord Servers

### Tier 1 (Primary - AI/Agent Communities)

| Server | Members | Invite Link | Why |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----|
| **OpenClaw** | Active | `discord.com/invite/clawd` | Showcase their own code - instant relevance |
| **AutoGPT** | ~56K | `discord.com/invite/autogpt` | Agentic AI community |
| **OpenAI** | ~850K | `discord.com/invite/openai` | AI builders, massive audience |

### Tier 2 (Technical/ML Communities)

| Server | Members | Invite Link | Why |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Hugging Face** | ~200K | `hf.co/join/discord` | Open-source AI, very technical |
| **The Programmer's Hangout** | ~205K | `discord.com/invite/programming` | General devs, non-AI-hype perspective |

### Tier 3 (Platform-Specific)

| Server | Members | Invite Link | Why |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Friends of Replit** (Unofficial) | ~20K | `discord.gg/friendsofreplit` | Vibe coders, deployment platform |
| **Replit Devs** (Official) | ~1.5K | `discord.com/invite/replit` | Official but may be invite-only |

### Note on LangChain

LangChain primarily uses **Slack** instead of Discord:
- Community link: `langchain.com/join-community`
- Consider posting there as well if you use Slack

## Quick Start Checklist (Per Server)

1. ☐ Click invite link
2. ☐ Complete any verification steps (some servers require this)
3. ☐ Read `#rules` or `#welcome` channel
4. ☐ Find `#showcase` or `#i-made-this` channel
5. ☐ Post your LogicArt content
6. ☐ Engage with responses

---

## Channel Types to Target

Look for these channel names in each server:

- `#showcase`
- `#i-made-this`
- `#resources`
- `#dev-tools`
- `#projects`
- `#community`
- `#made-with-replit` (Replit specific)

---

## Working Demo URLs

These URLs are verified working with the ES module parser fix:

1. **Agent Runner** (692 lines, core execution loop)
   ```
   https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.ts
   ```

2. **Context Compaction** (489 lines, session compression)
   ```
   https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/compact.ts
   ```

3. **Failover Logic** (203 lines, error handling)
   ```
   https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/failover-error.ts
   ```

### URL Pattern for Users
```
logic.art/?github=owner/repo&path=src/file.ts
```

---

## Key Insights from OpenClaw Analysis

Use these as talking points to show genuine value/contribution:

- Sophisticated auth profile rotation with cooldown tracking
- Auto-compaction on context overflow (users don't need `/compact` manually)
- Anthropic magic string scrubbing to prevent test token poisoning
- 47 unique execution paths in the agent runner
- Clean error classification taxonomy (billing/rate limit/auth/timeout)

---

## Tone Guidance

- **Contribution first, promotion second**
- Frame as "I visualized X and noticed some interesting patterns"
- Collaborative tone, NOT "I found your bugs"
- Let the quality of the analysis speak for itself
- Offer value before asking for anything

## Post Variations by Audience

### For OpenClaw Discord (Specific)

> Made some flowchart views of OpenClaw to help visualize how it works 🦞
> 
> 🔗 **Agent Runner** — Core execution loop with auth rotation
> https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.ts
> 
> 🔗 **Context Compaction** — How conversation history gets compressed
> https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/compact.ts
> 
> 🔗 **Failover Logic** — Error classification and retry flow
> https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/failover-error.ts
> 
> **A few interesting patterns I noticed:**
> - Sophisticated auth profile rotation with cooldown tracking
> - Auto-compaction on context overflow
> - Anthropic magic string scrubbing
> 
> Works with any public GitHub file — just swap repo/path:
> `logic.art/?github=owner/repo&path=src/file.ts`
> 
> Thought it might be useful for contributors! Open source: github.com/JPaulGrayson/Logicart

### For General AI/Agent Servers (LangChain, AutoGPT, OpenAI)

> Built a tool that turns TypeScript/JavaScript into interactive flowcharts. Useful for understanding complex agent codebases.
> 
> Example: Here's OpenClaw's agent runner visualized — 47 unique execution paths:
> https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.ts
> 
> Features:
> - Complexity analysis
> - Bug detection
> - Execution path counting
> - Works with any public GitHub file
> 
> Try your own repo: `logic.art/?github=owner/repo&path=src/file.ts`
> 
> Open source: github.com/JPaulGrayson/Logicart

---

### For General Dev Servers (Programmer's Hangout)

> Code visualization tool for TypeScript/JavaScript 📊
> 
> Paste any GitHub URL → get an interactive flowchart
> 
> Useful for:
> - Onboarding to unfamiliar codebases
> - Code review
> - Understanding complex control flow
> - Finding redundant logic paths
> 
> Example (OpenClaw's agent runner):
> https://logic.art/?github=openclaw/openclaw&path=src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.ts
> 
> Works with any public repo: `logic.art/?github=owner/repo&path=src/file.ts`

### For Replit Discord

> Made with Replit: LogicArt — code visualization tool 🎨
> 
> Turns TypeScript/JavaScript into interactive flowcharts. Just added GitHub deeplinks so you can visualize any public repo instantly.
> 
> Example: `logic.art/?github=owner/repo&path=src/file.ts`
>

> - Execution path analysis
> - Bug detection
> - Model Arena (compare AI models)
> 
> Built and deployed on Replit. Open source: github.com/JPaulGrayson/Logicart

- **BPMN Generation** — Business process diagrams from natural language
- **Full API/MCP** — Programmatic access for integration

---

## Posting Strategy

### Suggested Order

1. **OpenClaw Discord** — Most authentic, you're showcasing their code
2. **LangChain / AutoGPT** — Agent tool builders, natural fit
3. **OpenAI Developer Community** — Broader AI audience
4. **Replit Discord** — Home platform, supportive community
5. **Hugging Face / Programmer's Hangout** — Based on bandwidth

### Timing Tips

- Post during active hours (US morning/afternoon)
- Don't spam multiple channels in same server
- Wait for engagement before posting to next server
- Respond to comments to build relationships
