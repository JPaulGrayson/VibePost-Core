Since you are looking to launch LogicArt (and potentially find a home for your other interests like astrophotography and RVing), here are the best "forums" (Servers) on Discord for you.
Discord servers are often siloed, so you have to join them individually. Here are the ones that align best with your profile as a founder, developer, and astrophotographer.
1. For Your "LogicArt" Launch (AI & Dev Communities)
These are the best places to share your "Showcase" or "Launch" post. Look for channels named #showcase, #i-made-this, or #resources.
 * OpenAI Developer Community: The official gathering place for AI builders. Since LogicArt uses agents, this is a prime audience.
 * Hugging Face: The largest community for open-source AI. Very technical, very active.
 * The Programmer’s Hangout: One of the largest general coding servers. Good for broader feedback outside of just the "AI hype" crowd.
 * LangChain / AutoGPT (or "Agentic" servers): Since you are building agent-based tools ("ClawdBot" integration), search for servers specifically dedicated to AI Agents. Note: Check the GitHub repositories of the tools you use (like ClawdBot/Moltbot); they almost always have a "Join our Discord" badge which is the best place to find your exact target users.
2. For Astrophotography (Your Hobby)
The astrophotography community on Discord is surprisingly technical and helpful—perfect for someone with your background in optics and high-end gear (FLI cameras, etc.).
 * AstroBiscuit: Run by a popular YouTuber. It has about 20k members and is known for being very friendly but technically deep ("Nerds welcome").
 * Astrophotography & Co: A dedicated server purely for imaging. Great for discussing processing techniques (PixInsight workflows, etc.).
 * Cloudy Nights (Unofficial): While the main action is on their web forum, several Discord servers act as satellite chatrooms for the Cloudy Nights community.
3. For RV & Travel
 * RV Life with Five2Go: One of the more active communities for full-time or part-time RVers. Good for technical questions (Starlink setups, solar, towing).
 * Starlink for RVers: (Search for this via Disboard) – Highly specific, but given your tech background and need for connectivity while traveling, these communities are gold mines.
How to Find & Join These
Since you mentioned you haven't used your account much, here is the quick "How-To":
 * The "Compass" Icon: On the Discord desktop app, click the Compass icon (top left) labeled "Explore Discoverable Servers." Type "Astrophotography" or "AI" there to find verified public servers.
 * Disboard.org: This is a third-party search engine for Discord servers. It’s often better than the built-in search for finding niche communities (like specific coding frameworks or RV groups).
 * GitHub Badges: For your dev work, go to the GitHub repo of any tool you love (e.g., Replit, Vercel, or the ClawdBot repo). Scroll to the README—there is almost always a small purple "Discord" button. Clicking that is the safest way to join the right server.
Recommendation:
For your LogicArt launch, I would start by joining the OpenAI or LangChain Discords, finding their #showcase channel, and posting that draft we just wrote. That is where you will get the most "early adopter" traffic.
