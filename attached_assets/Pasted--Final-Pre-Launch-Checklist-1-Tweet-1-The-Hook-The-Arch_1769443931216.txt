🚀 Final Pre-Launch Checklist

1. Tweet 1 (The Hook): The Architecture Diagram (Wizard + Green/Yellow Lines).
2. Tweet 2 (The Solution): The Chaos vs. Order Ducks (Before/After).
3. Tweet 3 (The Visualizer): The LogicArt Video (or screenshot).
4. Tweet 4 (The Authority): The Actual Patent Image (The Receipt).

1. The Main Tweet (The Hook)
* The Text: "AI Agents have a fatal flaw: Amnesia... That’s why I built Quack."
* The Image: 🖼️ The Architecture Diagram (Wizard + Green/Yellow Lines)
* Why: This is your "Flag." It immediately establishes the Wizard persona, shows the Conductor hierarchy, and visually explains the "Green Zone" (Autonomy) vs. "Yellow Zone" (Manual Approval). It stops the scroll because it looks like a serious engineering schematic.
2. The Reply Tweet (The Problem & Solution)
* The Text: "Once your agents have a memory, they need a leader... Orchestrate turns Claude into 'The Conductor'..."
* The Image: 🖼️ The "Chaotic vs. Organized" Ducks (Before/After)
* Why: This is the emotional payoff.
    * Left Side (Chaos): Visually represents the pain of manual copy-pasting and "Amnesia."
    * Right Side (Order): Visually represents the "Conductor" bringing harmony to the swarm.
    * Instruction: If this is two separate images, stitch them side-by-side. If it's one image, it's perfect here.
3. The Reply Tweet (The Visualizer)
* The Text: "But how do you see what the swarm is thinking? Enter LogicArt..."
* The Image: 🖼️ LogicArt Screenshot / Schematic
* Why: You need to show that this isn't just text; it's visual. If you don't have a perfect LogicArt screenshot yet, you can use a "Network Node" visualization or a screenshot of a complex agent workflow.
🧵 Tweet 4: The Authority (Final Version)
Text:
This isn't my first rodeo with distributed systems.
Back in the 80s, I linked IBM 360 mainframes to local printers. In the 2000s, I pioneered distributed solid modeling at Alibre (US 2003/0078974).
We were doing "Vibe Coding" with 3D objects before the cloud even existed.
The tech changes. The architecture stays the same. 🧙‍♂️
